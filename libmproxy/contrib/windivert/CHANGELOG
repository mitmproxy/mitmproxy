WinDivert 1.0.0
    - First release of WinDivert 1.0
WinDivert 1.0.1
    - Fixed stack overflow bug in 32bit versions of the driver.
WinDivert 1.0.2
    - WinDivert now requires Administrator privileges in order to access
      (as opposed to just install) the WinDivert device.
WinDivert 1.0.3
    - Fix bug(s) relating to the parsing of IPv6 addresses.
    - DivertOpen() now returns more meaningful error codes on failure.
    - Two new helper API functions: DivertHelperParseIPvXAddress(..), X=4,6.
    - Renamed DivertHelperParse(..) to DivertHelperParsePacket(..).
WinDivert 1.0.4
    - Same as WinDivert 1.0.3 except:
      * Released with signed drivers.
      * MinGW compiled gcc-4.6
      * Minor documentation changes.
WinDivert 1.0.5
    - Fix the DIVERT_NETWORK_FORWARD_LAYER implementation.
    - Upgrade Visual Studio support to 2012.
WinDivert 1.1.0-rc
    - Re-brand "DIVERT" to "WINDIVERT" throughout the code-base.
    - New flag:
      * WINDIVERT_FLAG_NO_CHECKSUM: Do not guarantee that diverted packets
        have a correct checksum.
    - New default values and limits for various WinDivert parameters,
      including WINDIVERT_PARAM_QUEUE_LEN, WINDIVERT_PARAM_QUEUE_TIME, and
      the maximum filter length.
    - New extended WinDivert functions that support asynchronous I/O:
      * WinDivertRecvEx(..)
      * WinDivertSendEx(..)
    - The WinDivert driver now services reads (WinDivertRecv()) out-of-band.
    - The WinDivert driver now protects packet data from modification by
      other callout drivers and the user program.
    - The WinDivert service is no longer created when the driver fails to
      load.

    - Fixed a BSOD that sometimes occurs when the driver is unloaded.
WinDivert 1.1.2-rc
    - Renamed drivers to "WinDivert32.sys" and "WinDivert64.sys".  Both can
      exist in the same directory, and WinDivert.dll automatically loads the
      correct version.
    - Deprecate both the WinDivert.inf and WdfCoInstaller*.dll files.
WinDivert 1.1.3
    - Fixed a bug causing outbound TCP packets to be sometimes lost.
WinDivert 1.1.4

      WinDivertRecv(..) or WinDivertSend(..).
