__mitmproxy__ is a console tool that allows interactive examination and
modification of HTTP traffic. Use the _?_ shortcut key to view,
context-sensitive documentation from any __mitmproxy__ screen.

## Flow list

The flow list shows an index of captured flows in chronological order. 

<img src="@!urlTo("screenshots/mitmproxy.png")!@"/>

- __1__: A GET request, returning a 302 Redirect response.
- __2__: A GET request, returning 16.75kb of text/html data.
- __3__: A replayed request. 
- __4__: Intercepted flows are indicated with orange text. The user may edit
these flows, and then accept them (using the _a_ key) to continue. In this
case, the request has been intercepted on the way to the server.
- __5__: A response intercepted from the server on the way to the client.
- __6__: The event log can be toggled on and off using the _e_ shorcut key. This
pane shows events and errors that may not result in a flow that shows up in the
flow pane.
- __7__: Flow count.
- __8__: Various information on mitmproxy's state. In this case, we have an
interception pattern set to ".*".
- __9__: Bind address indicator - mitmproxy is listening on port 8080 of all
interfaces.


## Flow view

The __Flow View__ lets you inspect and manipulate a single flow:

<img src="@!urlTo("screenshots/mitmproxy-flowview.png")!@"/>

- __1__: Flow summary.
- __2__: The Request/Response tabs, showing you which part of the flow you are
currently viewing. In the example above, we're viewing the Response. Hit _tab_
to switch between the Response and the Request.
- __3__: Headers.
- __4__: Body.
- __5__: View Mode indicator. In this case, we're viewing the body in __hex__
mode. The other available modes are __pretty__, which uses a number of
heuristics to show you a friendly view of various content types, and __raw__,
which shows you exactly what's there without any changes. You can change modes
using the _m_ key.


## Key/Value Editor

It turns out that ordered key/value data is pervasive in HTTP communications,
so mitmproxy has a built-in editor to help edit and create this kind of data.
There are three ways to reach the __K/V Editor__ from the __Flow View__ screen:

- Editing request or response headers (_e_ for edit, then _h_ for headers) 
- Editing a query string (_e_ for edit, then _q_ for query)
- Editing a URL-encoded form (_e_ for edit, then _f_ for form)

If there is is no form or query string, an empty __K/V Editor__ will be started
to let you add one. Here is the __K/V Editor__ showing the headers from a
request:

<img src="@!urlTo("screenshots/mitmproxy-kveditor.png")!@"/>

To edit, navigate to the key or value you want to modify using the arrow or vi
navigation keys, and press enter. The background color will change to show that
you are in edit mode for the specified field:

<img src="@!urlTo("screenshots/mitmproxy-kveditor-editmode.png")!@"/>

Modify the field as desired, and press escape or enter to exit edit mode when
you're done. You can also add a key/value pair (_a_ key), delete a pair (_d_
key), spawn an external editor on a field (_e_ key). Be sure to consult the
context-sensitive help (_?_ key) for more.


# Example: Interception

__mitmproxy__'s interception functionality lets you pause an HTTP request or
response, inspect and modify it, and then accept it to send it on to the server
or client. 


### 1: Set an interception pattern

<img src="@!urlTo('mitmproxy-intercept-filt.png')!@"/>

We press _i_ to set an interception pattern. In this case, the __~q__ filter
pattern tells __mitmproxy__ to intercept all requests. For complete filter
syntax, see the [Filter expressions](@!urlTo("filters.html")!@) section of this
document, or the built-in help function in __mitmproxy__.

### 2: Intercepted connections are indicated with orange text:

<img src="@!urlTo('mitmproxy-intercept-mid.png')!@"/>

### 3: You can now view and modify the request:

<img src="@!urlTo('mitmproxy-intercept-options.png')!@"/>

In this case, we viewed the request by selecting it, pressed _e_ for "edit"
and _m_ for "method" to change the HTTP request method.

### 4: Accept the intercept to continue:

<img src="@!urlTo('mitmproxy-intercept-result.png')!@"/>

Finally, we press _a_ to accept the modified request, which is then sent on to
the server. In this case, we changed the request from an HTTP GET to
OPTIONS, and Google's server has responded with a 405 "Method not allowed".
