The preferred way to install mitmproxy - whether you're installing the latest
release or from source - is to use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/). If you
don't already have pip on your system, you can find installation instructions
[here](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).


## Installing the latest release

A single command will download and install the latest release of mitmproxy,
along with all its dependencies:

<pre class="terminal">
pip install mitmproxy
</pre>


## Installing from source

When installing from source, the easiest method is still to use pip. In this
case run:
    
<pre class="terminal">
pip install /path/to/source
</pre>

Note that if you're installing current git master, you will also have to
install the current git master of [netlib](http://github.com/mitmproxy/netlib) by
hand.

## OSX

- If you're running a Python interpreter installed with homebrew (or similar),
you may have to install some dependencies by hand. 
- Make sure that XCode is installed from the App Store, and that the
command-line tools have been downloaded (XCode/Preferences/Downloads).
- Now use __pip__ to do the installation, as above.

There are a few bits of customization you might want to do to make mitmproxy
comfortable to use on OSX. The default color scheme is optimized for a dark
background terminal, but you can select a palette for a light terminal
background with the --palette option. You can use the OSX <b>open</b> program
to create a simple and effective <b>~/.mailcap</b> file to view request and
response bodies:

<pre class="terminal">
application/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
audio/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
image/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
video/*; /usr/bin/open -Wn %s
</pre>
