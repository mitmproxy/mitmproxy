# What's Next

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the mitmproxy tutorial. 🎉

In this tutorial we have used mitmproxy to inspect requests initiated by curl.
You probably also want to inspect web traffic from your browser or some other tool.
To do so, you need to [configure mitmproxy as your client's proxy]({{< relref "overview-getting-started#configure-your-browser-or-device" >}}).

This tutorial only covered the most fundamental mitmproxy features. We recommend strongly to skim through the following
section as well, which describes most core concepts in more detail.
