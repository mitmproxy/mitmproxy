<h3>Bonus lesson: How is this tutorial implemented?</h3>
<p>
    This tutorial is implemented as a mitmproxy <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/addons-overview/">addon</a>.
    Addons allow to easily extend the functionality of mitmproxy using its API.
    The tutorial addon intercepts all HTTP requests.
    If the request's HTTP <code>Host</code> header is <code>tutorial.mitm.it</code>, the request is redirected to the tutorial's web application.
    The web application itself is implemented using <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a>.
    All other intercepted requests are forwarded to their original destination without modification.
    The core of the tutorial addon has less than 100 lines of code.
    The details go beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it should give you a glance of the advanced features that you can implement with mitmproxy.
