mitmweb
=======

**mitmweb** is mitmproxy's web-based user interface that allows interactive examination and modification of HTTP traffic. Like mitmproxy, it differs from mitmdump in that all flows are kept in memory, which means that it's intended for taking and manipulating
small-ish samples.

.. warning::

  Mitmweb is currently in beta. We consider it stable for all features currently exposed in the UI, but it still misses a lot of mitmproxy's features.
