Testing
=======

All the mitmproxy projects strive to maintain 100% code coverage. In general,
patches and pull requests will be declined unless they're accompanied by a
suitable extension to the test suite.

Our tests are written for the `py.test`_ or nose_ test frameworks.
At the point where you send your pull request, a command like this:

>>> py.test --cov mitmproxy --cov netlib

Should give output something like this:

.. code-block:: none

There are exceptions to the coverage requirement - for instance, much of the
console interface code can't sensibly be unit tested. These portions are
excluded from coverage analysis either in the **.coveragerc** file, or using
**#pragma no-cover** directives. To keep our coverage analysis relevant, we use
these measures as sparingly as possible.
