# User Interface

First of all, we need to become familiar with mitmproxy's user interface.
Open the terminal window in which you started mitmproxy.
You are in the default view of mitmproxy, which shows a list of flows.
You should see your browser's HTTP requests to load this tutorial.
mitmproxy adds rows to the view as new requests come in.

In the next lesson, you will learn to intercept requests before sending them to the server.
