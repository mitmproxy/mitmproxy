# Event Hooks

Addons hook into mitmproxy's internal mechanisms through event hooks. These are
implemented on addons as methods with a set of well-known names. Many events
receive `Flow` objects as arguments - by modifying these objects, addons can
change traffic on the fly. For instance, here is an addon that adds a response
header with a count of the number of responses seen:

## Supported Events

Below we list events supported by mitmproxy. We've added
annotations to illustrate the argument types.
