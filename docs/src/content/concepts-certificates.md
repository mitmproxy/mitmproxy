# About Certificates

Mitmproxy can decrypt encrypted traffic on the fly, as long as the client trusts
its built-in certificate authority. Usually this means that the mitmproxy CA
certificates have to be installed on the client device.

## Quick Setup

By far the easiest way to install the mitmproxy certificates is to use the
built-in certificate installation app. To do this, just start mitmproxy and
configure your target device with the correct proxy settings. Now start a
browser on the device, and visit the magic domain [mitm.it](http://mitm.it/). You should see
something like this:

Click on the relevant icon, follow the setup instructions for the platform
you're on and you are good to go.

Note: If you are using an iOS device, you should be using the Safari browser
so that it opens the proper prompts for installing the certificate.

## Installing the mitmproxy CA certificate manually

Sometimes using the quick install app is not an option - Java or the iOS
Simulator spring to mind - or you just need to do it manually for some other
reason. Below is a list of pointers to manual certificate installation
documentation for some common platforms. The mitmproxy CA cert is located in
`~/.mitmproxy` after it has been generated at the first start of mitmproxy.

- [IOS](http://jasdev.me/intercepting-ios-traffic)
  On recent iOS versions you also need to enable full trust for the mitmproxy
  root certificate:
    1. Go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings.
    2. Under "Enable full trust for root certificates", turn on trust for
       the mitmproxy certificate.

## The mitmproxy certificate authority

The first time **mitmproxy** or **mitmdump** is run, the mitmproxy Certificate
Authority (CA) is created in the config directory (`~/.mitmproxy` by default).
This CA is used for on-the-fly generation of dummy certificates for each of the
SSL sites that your client visits. Since your browser won't trust the mitmproxy
CA out of the box, you will see an SSL certificate warning every time you visit
a new SSL domain through mitmproxy. When you are testing a single site through a
browser, just accepting the bogus SSL cert manually is not too much trouble, but
there are a many circumstances where you will want to configure your testing
system or browser to trust the mitmproxy CA as a signing root authority. For
security reasons, the mitmproxy CA is generated uniquely on the first start and
is not shared between mitmproxy installations on different devices.

### Certificate Pinning

Some applications employ [Certificate
Pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning) to prevent
man-in-the-middle attacks. This means that **mitmproxy** and **mitmdump's**
certificates will not be accepted by these applications without modifying them.
It is recommended to use the passthrough feature in order to prevent
**mitmproxy** and **mitmdump** from intercepting traffic to these specific
domains. If you want to intercept the pinned connections, you need to patch the
application manually. For Android and (jailbroken) iOS devices, various tools
exist to accomplish this.

## CA and cert files

The files created by mitmproxy in the .mitmproxy directory are as follows:

|                       |                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mitmproxy-ca.pem      | The certificate **and the private key** in PEM format.                               |
| mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem | The certificate in PEM format. Use this to distribute on most non-Windows platforms. |
| mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12 | The certificate in PKCS12 format. For use on Windows.                                |
| mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer | Same file as .pem, but with an extension expected by some Android devices.           |

## Using a custom server certificate

You can use your own (leaf) certificate by passing the `--cert
[domain=]path_to_certificate` option to mitmproxy. Mitmproxy then uses the
provided certificate for interception of the specified domain instead of
generating a certificate signed by its own CA.

The certificate file is expected to be in the PEM format. You can include
intermediary certificates right below your leaf certificate, so that your PEM
file roughly looks like this:

    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
    <private key>
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <cert>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <intermediary cert (optional)>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

For example, you can generate a certificate in this format using these
instructions:

{{< highlight bash  >}}
openssl genrsa -out cert.key 2048
# (Specify the mitm domain as Common Name, e.g. \*.google.com)
openssl req -new -x509 -key cert.key -out cert.crt
cat cert.key cert.crt \> cert.pem
{{< / highlight >}}

Now, you can run mitmproxy with the generated certificate:

**For all domain names**

{{< highlight bash  >}}
mitmproxy --cert *=cert.pem
{{< / highlight >}}

**For specific domain names**

{{< highlight bash  >}}
mitmproxy --cert *.example.com=cert.pem
{{< / highlight >}}

**Note:** `*.example.com` is for all the subdomains. You can also use
`www.example.com` for a particular subdomain.

## Using a custom certificate authority

By default, mitmproxy will use `~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca.pem` as the
certificate authority to generate certificates for all domains for which
no custom certificate is provided (see above). You can use your own
certificate authority by passing the `--set confdir=DIRECTORY` option to
mitmproxy. Mitmproxy will then look for `mitmproxy-ca.pem` in the
specified directory. If no such file exists, it will be generated
automatically.

## Using a client side certificate

You can use a client certificate by passing the `--set client_certs=DIRECTORY|FILE`
option to mitmproxy. Using a directory allows certs to be selected based on
hostname, while using a filename allows a single specific certificate to be used
for all SSL connections. Certificate files must be in the PEM format and should
contain both the unencrypted private key and the certificate.

### Multiple client certificates

You can specify a directory to `--set client_certs=DIRECTORY`, in which case the matching
certificate is looked up by filename. So, if you visit example.org, mitmproxy
looks for a file named `example.org.pem` in the specified directory and uses
this as the client cert.
