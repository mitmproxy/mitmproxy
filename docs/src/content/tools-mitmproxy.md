## mitmproxy

{{< figure src="/screenshots/mitmproxy.png" >}}

**mitmproxy** is a console tool that allows interactive examination and
modification of HTTP traffic. It differs from mitmdump in that all flows are
kept in memory, which means that it's intended for taking and manipulating
small-ish samples. Use the `?` shortcut key to view, context-sensitive
documentation from any **mitmproxy** screen.
