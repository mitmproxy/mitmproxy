# How mitmproxy works

Mitmproxy is an enormously flexible tool. Knowing exactly how the proxying
process works will help you deploy it creatively, and take into account its
fundamental assumptions and how to work around them. This document explains
mitmproxy's proxy mechanism in detail, starting with the simplest unencrypted
explicit proxying, and working up to the most complicated interaction
-transparent proxying of TLS-protected traffic[^1] in the presence of [Server
Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication).

## Explicit HTTP

Configuring the client to use mitmproxy as an explicit proxy is the
simplest and most reliable way to intercept traffic. The proxy protocol
is codified in the [HTTP RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230), so
the behaviour of both the client and the server is well defined, and
usually reliable. In the simplest possible interaction with mitmproxy, a
client connects directly to the proxy, and makes a request that looks
like this:

```http
GET http://example.com/index.html HTTP/1.1
```

This is a proxy GET request - an extended form of the vanilla HTTP GET
request that includes a schema and host specification, and it includes
all the information mitmproxy needs to proceed.

1. The client connects to the proxy and makes a request.
2. Mitmproxy connects to the upstream server and simply forwards the request on.


## Explicit HTTPS

The process for an explicitly proxied HTTPS connection is quite
different. The client connects to the proxy and makes a request that
looks like this:

```http
CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
```

A conventional proxy can neither view nor manipulate a TLS-encrypted
data stream, so a CONNECT request simply asks the proxy to open a pipe
between the client and server. The proxy here is just a facilitator - it
blindly forwards data in both directions without knowing anything about
the contents. The negotiation of the TLS connection happens over this
pipe, and the subsequent flow of requests and responses are completely
opaque to the proxy.

### The MITM in mitmproxy

This is where mitmproxy's fundamental trick comes into play. The MITM
in its name stands for Man-In-The-Middle - a reference to the process we
use to intercept and interfere with these theoretically opaque data
streams. The basic idea is to pretend to be the server to the client,
and pretend to be the client to the server, while we sit in the middle
decoding traffic from both sides. The tricky part is that the
[Certificate
Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) system
is designed to prevent exactly this attack, by allowing a trusted
third-party to cryptographically sign a server's certificates to verify
that they are legit. If this signature doesn't match or is from a
non-trusted party, a secure client will simply drop the connection and
refuse to proceed. Despite the many shortcomings of the CA system as it
exists today, this is usually fatal to attempts to MITM a TLS connection
for analysis. Our answer to this conundrum is to become a trusted
Certificate Authority ourselves. Mitmproxy includes a full CA
implementation that generates interception certificates on the fly. To
get the client to trust these certificates, we
[register mitmproxy as a trusted CA with the device
manually]({{< relref concepts-certificates >}}).

### Complication 1: What's the remote hostname?

To proceed with this plan, we need to know the domain name to use in the
interception certificate - the client will verify that the certificate is for
the domain it's connecting to, and abort if this is not the case. At first
blush, it seems that the CONNECT request above gives us all we need - in this
example, both of these values are "example.com". But what if the client had
initiated the connection as follows:

```http
CONNECT 10.1.1.1:443 HTTP/1.1
```

Using the IP address is perfectly legitimate because it gives us enough
information to initiate the pipe, even though it doesn't reveal the
remote hostname.

Mitmproxy has a cunning mechanism that smooths this over - [upstream certificate
sniffing]({{< relref "overview-features#upstream-certificates" >}}). As soon as
we see the CONNECT request, we pause the client part of the conversation, and
initiate a simultaneous connection to the server. We complete the TLS handshake
with the server, and inspect the certificates it used. Now, we use the Common
Name in the upstream certificates to generate the dummy certificate for the
client. Voila, we have the correct hostname to present to the client, even if it
was never specified.

### Complication 2: Subject Alternative Name

Enter the next complication. Sometimes, the certificate Common Name is
not, in fact, the hostname that the client is connecting to. This is
because of the optional [Subject Alternative
Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubjectAltName) field in the
certificate that allows an arbitrary number of alternative domains to be
specified. If the expected domain matches any of these, the client will
proceed, even though the domain doesn't match the certificate CN. The
answer here is simple: when we extract the CN from the upstream cert, we
also extract the SANs, and add them to the generated dummy certificate.

### Complication 3: Server Name Indication

One of the big limitations of vanilla TLS is that each certificate
requires its own IP address. This means that you couldn't do virtual
hosting where multiple domains with independent certificates share the
same IP address. In a world with a rapidly shrinking IPv4 address pool
this is a problem, and we have a solution in the form of the [Server
Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
extension to the TLS protocols. This lets the client specify the remote
server name at the start of the TLS handshake, which then lets the
server select the right certificate to complete the process.

SNI breaks our upstream certificate sniffing process, because when we
connect without using SNI, we get served a default certificate that may
have nothing to do with the certificate expected by the client. The
solution is another tricky complication to the client connection
process. After the client connects, we allow the TLS handshake to
continue until just **after** the SNI value has been passed to us. Now
we can pause the conversation, and initiate an upstream connection using
the correct SNI value, which then serves us the correct upstream
certificate, from which we can extract the expected CN and SANs.

### Putting it all together

Lets put all of this together into the complete explicitly proxied HTTPS
flow.

{{< figure src="/schematics/how-mitmproxy-works-explicit-https.png" title="Explicit HTTPS" >}}

1. The client makes a connection to mitmproxy, and issues an HTTP CONNECT
    request.
2. Mitmproxy responds with a `200 Connection Established`, as if it has set up
    the CONNECT pipe.
3. The client believes it's talking to the remote server, and initiates the TLS
    connection. It uses SNI to indicate the hostname it is connecting to.
4. Mitmproxy connects to the server, and establishes a TLS connection using the
    SNI hostname indicated by the client.
5. The server responds with the matching certificate, which contains the CN and
    SAN values needed to generate the interception certificate.
6. Mitmproxy generates the interception cert, and continues the client TLS
    handshake paused in step 3.
7. The client sends the request over the established TLS connection.
8. Mitmproxy passes the request on to the server over the TLS connection
    initiated in step 4.

## Transparent HTTP

When a transparent proxy is used, the connection is redirected into a
proxy at the network layer, without any client configuration being
required. This makes transparent proxying ideal for those situations
where you can't change client behaviour - proxy-oblivious Android
applications being a common example.

To achieve this, we need to introduce two extra components. The first is
a redirection mechanism that transparently reroutes a TCP connection
destined for a server on the Internet to a listening proxy server. This
usually takes the form of a firewall on the same host as the proxy
server - [iptables](http://www.netfilter.org/) on Linux or
[pf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_\(firewall\)) on OSX. Once the
client has initiated the connection, it makes a vanilla HTTP request,
which might look something like this:

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

Note that this request differs from the explicit proxy variation, in
that it omits the scheme and hostname. How, then, do we know which
upstream host to forward the request to? The routing mechanism that has
performed the redirection keeps track of the original destination for
us. Each routing mechanism has a different way of exposing this data, so
this introduces the second component required for working transparent
proxying: a host module that knows how to retrieve the original
destination address from the router. In mitmproxy, this takes the form
of a built-in set of
[modules](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/master/mitmproxy/platform)
that know how to talk to each platform's redirection mechanism. Once we
have this information, the process is fairly straight-forward.

{{< figure src="/schematics/how-mitmproxy-works-transparent.png" title="Transparent" >}}

1. The client makes a connection to the server.
2. The router redirects the connection to mitmproxy, which is typically
    listening on a local port of the same host. Mitmproxy then consults
    the routing mechanism to establish what the original destination
    was.
3. Now, we simply read the client's request...
4. ... and forward it upstream.

## Transparent HTTPS

The first step is to determine whether we should treat an incoming
connection as HTTPS. The mechanism for doing this is simple - we use the
routing mechanism to find out what the original destination port is. All
incoming connections pass through different layers which can determine
the actual protocol to use. Automatic TLS detection works for SSLv3, TLS
1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2 by looking for a *ClientHello* message at the
beginning of each connection. This works independently of the used TCP
port.

From here, the process is a merger of the methods we've described for
transparently proxying HTTP, and explicitly proxying HTTPS. We use the
routing mechanism to establish the upstream server address, and then
proceed as for explicit HTTPS connections to establish the CN and SANs,
and cope with SNI.

1. The client makes a connection to the server.
2. The router redirects the connection to mitmproxy, which is typically
    listening on a local port of the same host. Mitmproxy then consults the
    routing mechanism to establish what the original destination was.
3. The client believes it's talking to the remote server, and
    initiates the TLS connection. It uses SNI to indicate the hostname
    it is connecting to.
4. Mitmproxy connects to the server, and establishes a TLS connection
    using the SNI hostname indicated by the client.
5. The server responds with the matching certificate, which contains
    the CN and SAN values needed to generate the interception
    certificate.
6. Mitmproxy generates the interception cert, and continues the client
    TLS handshake paused in step 3.
7. The client sends the request over the established TLS connection.
8. Mitmproxy passes the request on to the server over the TLS
    connection initiated in step 4.
