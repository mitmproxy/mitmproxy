17 May 2018: mitmproxy 4.0

  ** Features **
    * mitmproxy now requires Python 3.6!
    * Moved the core to asyncio - which gives us a very significant performance boost!
    * Reduce memory consumption by using `SO_KEEPALIVE` (#3076)
    * Export request as httpie command (#3031)
    * Configure mitmproxy console keybindings with the keys.yaml file. See docs for more.

  ** Breaking Changes **
    * The --conf command-line flag is now --confdir, and specifies the mitmproxy configuration
    directory, instead of the options yaml file (which is at `config.yaml` under the configuration directory).
    * `allow_remote` got replaced by `block_global` and `block_private` (#3100)
    * No more custom events (#3093)
    * The `cadir` option has been renamed to `confdir`
    * We no longer magically capture print statements in addons and translate
    them to logs. Please use `ctx.log.info` explicitly.

  ** Bugfixes **
    * Correctly block connections from remote clients with IPv4-mapped IPv6 client addresses (#3099)
    * Expand `~` in paths during the `cut` command (#3078)
    * Remove socket listen backlog constraint
    * Improve handling of user script exceptions (#3050, #2837)
    * Ignore signal errors on windows
    * Fix traceback for commands with un-terminated escape characters (#2810)
    * Fix request replay when proxy is bound to local interface (#2647)
    * Fix traceback when running scripts on a flow twice (#2838)
    * Fix traceback when killing intercepted flow (#2879)
    * And lots of typos, docs improvements, revamped examples, and general fixes!

26 December 2016: mitmproxy 1.0

    * All mitmproxy tools are now Python 3 only! We plan to support Python 3.5 and higher.

    * Web-Based User Interface: Mitmproxy now officially has a web-based user interface
      called mitmweb. We consider it stable for all features currently exposed
      in the UI, but it still misses a lot of mitmproxy’s options.

    * Windows Compatibility: With mitmweb, mitmproxy is now usable on Windows.
      We are also introducing an installer (kindly sponsored by BitRock) that
      simplifies setup.

    * Configuration: The config file format is now a single YAML file. In most cases,
      converting to the new format should be trivial - please see the docs for
      more information.

    * Console: Significant UI improvements - including sorting of flows by
      size, type and url, status bar improvements, much faster indentation for
      HTTP views, and more.

    * HTTP/2: Significant improvements, but is temporarily disabled by default
      due to wide-spread protocol implementation errors on some large website

    * WebSocket: The protocol implementation is now mature, and is enabled by
      default. Complete UI support is coming in the next release. Hooks for
      message interception and manipulation are available.

24 July 2015: mitmproxy 0.13

    * Upstream certificate validation. See the --verify-upstream-cert,
      --upstream-trusted-confdir and --upstream-trusted-ca parameters. Thanks to
      Kyle Morton (github.com/kyle-m) for his work on this.

    * Add HTTP transparent proxy mode. This uses the host headers from HTTP
      traffic (rather than SNI and IP address information from the OS) to
      implement perform transparent proxying. Thanks to github.com/ijiro123 for
      this feature.

    * Add ~src and ~dst REGEX filters, allowing matching on source and
      destination addresses in the form of <IP>:<Port>

    * mitmproxy console: change g/G keyboard shortcuts to match less. Thanks to
      Jose Luis Honorato (github.com/jlhonora).

    * mitmproxy console: Flow marking and unmarking. Marked flows are not
      deleted when the flow list is cleared. Thanks to Jake Drahos
      (github.com/drahosj).

    * mitmproxy console: add marking of flows

    * Remove the certforward feature. It was added to allow exploitation of
      #gotofail, which is no longer a common vulnerability. Permitting this
      hugely increased the complexity of packaging and distributing mitmproxy.

      and many options that were previously manipulated directly via a
      keybinding have been moved there.

    * mitmproxy console: Big improvement in palettes. This includes improvements
      to all colour schemes. Palettes now set the terminal background colour by
      default, and a new --palette-transparent option has been added to disable
      this.

    * mitmproxy console: g/G shortcuts throughout mitmproxy console to jump
      to the beginning/end of the current view.

      master keys. This can be used with tools like Wireshark to allow TLS
      decoding.

    * Server facing SSL cipher suite specification (thanks to Jim Shaver).

    * Official support for transparent proxying on FreeBSD - thanks to Mike C
      (http://github.com/mike-pt).

    * Many other small bugfixes and improvemenets throughout the project.

      cert handling, and improves compatibility with Windows, where the rules
      governing permitted file names are weird, resulting in errors for some
      valid IDNA-encoded names.

    * Display transfer rates for responses in the flow list.

    * Many other small bugfixes and improvements.

      on flows, based on a matching pattern.

    * A graphical editor for path components in mitmproxy.

    * A small set of standard user-agent strings, which can be used easily in
      the header editor.

    * Proxy authentication to limit access to mitmproxy

16 November 2012: pathod 0.3:

    A release focusing on shoring up our fuzzing capabilities, especially with
    pathoc.

    * pathoc -q and -r options, output full request and response text.

    * pathod -q and -r options, add full request and response text to pathod's
      log buffer.

    * pathoc -o option, a one-shot mode that exits after the first non-ignored
      response.

    * pathoc and pathod -e option, which explains the resulting message by
      expanding random and generated portions, and logging a reproducible
      specification.

    * Streamline the specification language. HTTP response message is now
      specified using the "r" mnemonic.

    * Add a "u" mnemonic for specifying User-Agent strings. Add a set of

    * Let pathod pick an arbitrary open port if -p 0 is specified.

    * Move from Tornado to netlib, the network library written for mitmproxy.

    * Move the web application to Flask.

    * Massively expand the documentation.


5 April 2012: mitmproxy 0.8:

    * Detailed tutorial for Android interception. Some features that land in
      this release have finally made reliable Android interception possible.

    * Upstream-cert mode, which uses information from the upstream server to
      generate interception certificates.

    * Replacement patterns that let you easily do global replacements in flows
      matching filter patterns. Can be specified on the command-line, or edited
      interactively.

    * Much more sophisticated and usable pretty printing of request bodies.
      Support for auto-indentation of Javascript, inspection of image EXIF
      data, and more.

    * Details view for flows, showing connection and SSL cert information (X
      keyboard shortcut).

    * Server certificates are now stored and serialized in saved traffic for
      later analysis. This means that the 0.8 serialization format is NOT
      compatible with 0.7.

    * Many other improvements, including bugfixes, and expanded scripting API,
      and more sophisticated certificate handling.


20 February 2012: mitmproxy 0.7:

    * New built-in key/value editor. This lets you interactively edit URL query
      strings, headers and URL-encoded form data.

    * Extend script API to allow duplication and replay of flows.

    * API for easy manipulation of URL-encoded forms and query strings.

    * Add "D" shortcut in mitmproxy to duplicate a flow.

    * Reverse proxy mode. In this mode mitmproxy acts as an HTTP server,
      forwarding all traffic to a specified upstream server.

    * UI improvements - use unicode characters to make GUI more compact,
      improve spacing and layout throughout.

    * Add support for filtering by HTTP method.

    * Add the ability to specify an HTTP body size limit.

    * Move to typed netstrings for serialization format - this makes 0.7
      backwards-incompatible with serialized data from 0.6!

    * Significant improvements in speed and responsiveness of UI.

    * Many minor bugfixes and improvements.


7 August 2011: mitmproxy 0.6:

    * New scripting API that allows much more flexible and fine-grained
      rewriting of traffic. See the docs for more info.

    * Support for gzip and deflate content encodings. A new "z"
      keybinding in mitmproxy to let us quickly encode and decode content, plus
      automatic decoding for the "pretty" view mode.

    * An event log, viewable with the "v" shortcut in mitmproxy, and the
      "-e" command-line flag in mitmdump.

    * Huge performance improvements: mitmproxy interface, loading
      large numbers of flows from file.

    * A new "replace" convenience method for all flow objects, that does a
      universal regex-based string replacement.

    * Header management has been rewritten to maintain both case and order.

    * Improved stability for SSL interception.

    * Default expiry time on generated SSL certs has been dropped to avoid an
      OpenSSL overflow bug that caused certificates to expire in the distant
      past on some systems.

    * A "pretty" view mode for JSON and form submission data.

    * Expanded documentation and examples.

    * Countless other small improvements and bugfixes.


27 June 2011: mitmproxy 0.5:

    * An -n option to start the tools without binding to a proxy port.

    * Allow scripts, hooks, sticky cookies etc. to run on flows loaded from
      save files.

    * Regularize command-line options for mitmproxy and mitmdump.

    * Add an "SSL exception" to mitmproxy's license to remove possible
      distribution issues.

    * Add a --cert-wait-time option to make mitmproxy pause after a new SSL
      certificate is generated. This can pave over small discrepancies in
      system time between the client and server.

    * Handle viewing big request and response bodies more elegantly. Only
      render the first 100k of large documents, and try to avoid running the
      XML indenter on non-XML data.

    * BUGFIX: Make the "revert" keyboard shortcut in mitmproxy work after a
      flow has been replayed.

    * BUGFIX: Repair a problem that sometimes caused SSL connections to consume
      100% of CPU.


30 March 2011: mitmproxy 0.4

    * Full serialization of HTTP conversations

    * Client and server replay

    * On-the-fly generation of dummy SSL certificates

    * mitmdump has "grown up" into a powerful tcpdump-like tool for HTTP/S

    * Dozens of improvements to the mitmproxy console interface

    * Python scripting hooks for programmatic modification of traffic


1 March 2010: mitmproxy 0.2

    * Big speed and responsiveness improvements, thanks to Thomas Roth

    * Support urwid 0.9.9

    * Terminal beeping based on filter expressions

    * Filter expressions for terminal beeps, limits, interceptions and sticky
      cookies can now be passed on the command line.

    * Save requests and responses to file

    * Split off non-interactive dump functionality into a new tool called
      mitmdump

    * "A" will now accept all intercepted connections

    * Lots of bugfixes
