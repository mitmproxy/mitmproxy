16 June 2013: mitmproxy 0.9.1:

    * Use "correct" case for Content-Type headers added by mitmproxy.
    
    * Make UTF environment detection more robust. 

    * Improved MIME-type detection for viewers.
    
    * Always read files in binary mode (Windows compatibility fix).
    
    * Some developer documentation.
    

15 May 2013: mitmproxy 0.9:

    * Upstream certs mode is now the default.

    * Add a WSGI container that lets you host in-proxy web applications.
    
    * Full transparent proxy support for Linux and OSX.
    
    * Introduce netlib, a common codebase for mitmproxy and pathod
      (http://github.com/cortesi/netlib).

    * Full support for SNI.
    
    * Color palettes for mitmproxy, tailored for light and dark terminal
      backgrounds.

    * Stream flows to file as responses arrive with the "W" shortcut in
      mitmproxy.

    * Extend the filter language, including ~d domain match operator, ~a to
      match asset flows (js, images, css).

    * Follow mode in mitmproxy ("F" shortcut) to "tail" flows as they arrive.
    
    * --dummy-certs option to specify and preserve the dummy certificate
      directory.

    * Server replay from the current captured buffer.
    
    * Huge improvements in content views. We now have viewers for AMF, HTML,
      JSON, Javascript, images, XML, URL-encoded forms, as well as hexadecimal
      and raw views.

    * Add Set Headers, analagous to replacement hooks. Defines headers that are set
      on flows, based on a matching pattern.

    * A graphical editor for path components in mitmproxy.
    
    * A small set of standard user-agent strings, which can be used easily in
      the header editor.

    * Proxy authentication to limit access to mitmproxy


5 April 2012: mitmproxy 0.8:

    * Detailed tutorial for Android interception. Some features that land in
      this release have finally made reliable Android interception possible.

    * Upstream-cert mode, which uses information from the upstream server to
      generate interception certificates.

    * Replacement patterns that let you easily do global replacements in flows
      matching filter patterns. Can be specified on the command-line, or edited
      interactively.

    * Much more sophisticated and usable pretty printing of request bodies.
      Support for auto-indentation of Javascript, inspection of image EXIF
      data, and more.

    * Details view for flows, showing connection and SSL cert information (X
      keyboard shortcut).

    * Server certificates are now stored and serialized in saved traffic for
      later analysis. This means that the 0.8 serialization format is NOT
      compatible with 0.7.

    * Many other improvements, including bugfixes, and expanded scripting API,
      and more sophisticated certificate handling.


20 February 2012: mitmproxy 0.7:

    * New built-in key/value editor. This lets you interactively edit URL query
      strings, headers and URL-encoded form data.

    * Extend script API to allow duplication and replay of flows.

    * API for easy manipulation of URL-encoded forms and query strings.

    * Add "D" shortcut in mitmproxy to duplicate a flow.

    * Reverse proxy mode. In this mode mitmproxy acts as an HTTP server,
      forwarding all traffic to a specified upstream server.

    * UI improvements - use unicode characters to make GUI more compact,
      improve spacing and layout throughout.

    * Add support for filtering by HTTP method.

    * Add the ability to specify an HTTP body size limit.

    * Move to typed netstrings for serialization format - this makes 0.7
      backwards-incompatible with serialized data from 0.6!

    * Significant improvements in speed and responsiveness of UI.

    * Many minor bugfixes and improvements.


7 August 2011: mitmproxy 0.6:

    * New scripting API that allows much more flexible and fine-grained
      rewriting of traffic. See the docs for more info.

    * Support for gzip and deflate content encodings. A new "z"
      keybinding in mitmproxy to let us quickly encode and decode content, plus
      automatic decoding for the "pretty" view mode.

    * An event log, viewable with the "v" shortcut in mitmproxy, and the
      "-e" command-line flag in mitmdump.

    * Huge performance improvements: mitmproxy interface, loading
      large numbers of flows from file.

    * A new "replace" convenience method for all flow objects, that does a
      universal regex-based string replacement.

    * Header management has been rewritten to maintain both case and order.

    * Improved stability for SSL interception.

    * Default expiry time on generated SSL certs has been dropped to avoid an
      OpenSSL overflow bug that caused certificates to expire in the distant
      past on some systems.

    * A "pretty" view mode for JSON and form submission data.

    * Expanded documentation and examples.

    * Countless other small improvements and bugfixes.


27 June 2011: mitmproxy 0.5:

    * An -n option to start the tools without binding to a proxy port.

    * Allow scripts, hooks, sticky cookies etc. to run on flows loaded from
      save files.

    * Regularize command-line options for mitmproxy and mitmdump.

    * Add an "SSL exception" to mitmproxy's license to remove possible
      distribution issues.

    * Add a --cert-wait-time option to make mitmproxy pause after a new SSL
      certificate is generated. This can pave over small discrepancies in
      system time between the client and server.

    * Handle viewing big request and response bodies more elegantly. Only
      render the first 100k of large documents, and try to avoid running the
      XML indenter on non-XML data.

    * BUGFIX: Make the "revert" keyboard shortcut in mitmproxy work after a
      flow has been replayed.

    * BUGFIX: Repair a problem that sometimes caused SSL connections to consume
      100% of CPU.


30 March 2011: mitmproxy 0.4

    * Full serialization of HTTP conversations

    * Client and server replay

    * On-the-fly generation of dummy SSL certificates

    * mitmdump has "grown up" into a powerful tcpdump-like tool for HTTP/S

    * Dozens of improvements to the mitmproxy console interface

    * Python scripting hooks for programmatic modification of traffic


1 March 2010: mitmproxy 0.2

    * Big speed and responsiveness improvements, thanks to Thomas Roth

    * Support urwid 0.9.9

    * Terminal beeping based on filter expressions

    * Filter expressions for terminal beeps, limits, interceptions and sticky
      cookies can now be passed on the command line.

    * Save requests and responses to file

    * Split off non-interactive dump functionality into a new tool called
      mitmdump

    * "A" will now accept all intercepted connections

    * Lots of bugfixes
