# Oximy Sensor

> The open-source desktop agent that monitors AI tool usage across your organization

![Oximy Sensor](assets/intro.png)

## What it does

Oximy Sensor runs on employee devices and monitors network connections to detect AI tool usage. It captures what AI applications are being accessed—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and 2,200+ other models—without requiring any code changes or SDK integration.

## How it works

The sensor intercepts TLS at the system boundary, logging:
- Which AI tools and models are being used
- When requests are made
- Which devices are making them
- Request/response metadata

All events are sent to your Oximy dashboard for centralized visibility and governance.
